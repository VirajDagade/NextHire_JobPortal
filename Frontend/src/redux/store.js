    configureStore is a function from Redux Toolkit that creates a store for your application

    A store is where your app's state (data) is kept, and configureStore makes setting it up easier by adding useful features automatically.
    The store keeps your app's data in one place.

    Reducer: You provide functions (reducers) to tell the store how to update the data when actions happen.
